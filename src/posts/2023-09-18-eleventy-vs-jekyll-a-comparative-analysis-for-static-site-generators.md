## Introduction

Static site generators have become increasingly popular for building fast, secure, and scalable websites. Two of the most well-known options are Eleventy and Jekyll. In this blog post, we'll compare these two static site generators to help you make an informed decision for your next project.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is one of the oldest and most popular static site generators. It's built in Ruby and has a large community of contributors. Jekyll is often used with GitHub Pages, making it easy to deploy your site.

## What is Eleventy?

Eleventy, on the other hand, is a newer static site generator built in JavaScript. It aims to be a simpler, more flexible alternative to other static site generators.

## Language and Ecosystem

- Jekyll: Ruby
- Eleventy: JavaScript

If you're more comfortable with JavaScript, you might find Eleventy easier to work with. Conversely, if you're a Ruby enthusiast, Jekyll could be a better fit.

## Templating Engines

- Jekyll: Liquid
- Eleventy: Nunjucks, Liquid, Markdown, and more.

Eleventy offers more flexibility when it comes to choosing a templating engine, while Jekyll primarily uses Liquid.

## Performance

Both generators are designed to create fast, efficient websites. However, Eleventy's simpler architecture often results in quicker build times, especially for larger sites.

## Community and Plugins

- Jekyll: Larger community, more plugins
- Eleventy: Growing community, fewer but more modern plugins

Jekyll's longer history means it has a larger community and more plugins. Eleventy is newer but has a rapidly growing community and a modern approach to plugins.

## Deployment

Both Jekyll and Eleventy can be deployed easily on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, and GitHub Pages. Jekyll has native support for GitHub Pages, while Eleventy offers more flexibility in deployment options.

## Learning Curve

- Jekyll: Moderate, especially if you're new to Ruby
- Eleventy: Easier, particularly if you're familiar with JavaScript

## Conclusion

Choosing between Eleventy and Jekyll ultimately depends on your project requirements, your familiarity with Ruby or JavaScript, and your preferences for community support and plugins. Both are excellent choices for static site generation, but they offer different advantages and limitations.
