Based on the [Madri Lene's Eleventy Starter](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) which is based on Andy Bell's talk 'Be the browserâ€™s mentor, not its micromanager' and his work on building modern accessible yet performant websites, like buildexcellentwebsit.es and [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/). I tend to admire his work and views. And thanks for [Madri Lene](https://front-end.social/@lene) for making this starter, which I'm pretty sure is helping and will help many to build effective performant websites.

To work with it efficiently you should be familiar with [cube.fyi](https://cube.fyi/), [utopia.fyi](https://utopia.fyi/) and [every-layout.dev](https://every-layout.dev/).
