**Andy Bell**

His CSS methodology "CUBE" makes sense to me. It goes hand in hand with _Every Layout_ (which he co-authors). He has recently published an approach that incorporates Tailwind CSS into his methodology. Also, I learned how to use Eleventy in 2020 with his (now free) course.

**Heydon Pickering**

I strongly orientate myself on Heydon's approaches and really love his books.

**Aleksandr Hovhannisyan**

I love order and structure. Aleksandr does this in an exemplary way, which is why I based the structure of eleventy.js on his personal site. The 301 redirect solution I'm using is from his blog.
